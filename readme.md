# Debuff Analyzer

Analyzes logs from https://classic.warcraftlogs.com for events where one debuff pushes off another debuff because of the debuff limit in WoW Classic.

It only lists events where the only 2 things that happended in the same time slot was one debuff faded and another was applied.

The app is made using Blazor WebAssembly.
